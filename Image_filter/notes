Max Filter
Use When:
You want to enhance bright features in an image, such as highlights or edges.
You're dealing with images that have lower-value noise (e.g., salt noise).
You need to perform texture analysis or edge detection.

Min Filter
Use When:
You want to preserve dark features while removing bright noise (e.g., salt noise).
You need to reduce the size of bright regions in an image.
You're working on background subtraction tasks where darker areas need emphasis.

Median Filter
Use When:
You need to remove impulse noise (salt-and-pepper noise) while preserving edges and details.
Smoothing is required without significant blurring, especially in medical or high-contrast images.
You want to enhance overall image quality without losing important features.

Mean Filter
Use When:
You want to reduce random noise in an image but can tolerate some blurriness.
You’re intentionally looking to create a soft or blurred effect.
The image quality is relatively good, and you're looking for slight smoothing.

Summary
Max Filter: For bright feature enhancement.
Min Filter: For dark feature preservation.
Median Filter: For noise reduction with edge preservation.
Mean Filter: For general smoothing and blurring.

For a blurred image, the most suitable filters from the list you provided are:

1. Median Filter
Why: It can help remove certain types of noise without overly blurring the image further. While it doesn’t directly deblur, it preserves edges better than the mean filter, which can be beneficial if the image is slightly blurred with noise.
2. Mean Filter
Why: This can smooth out some minor artifacts, but it may increase blurriness, so it's not the best choice for strong blur. It’s more suitable for noise reduction than for recovering sharpness.
