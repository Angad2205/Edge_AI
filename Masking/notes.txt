Key Points:
Face Detection:

The code uses OpenCV's CascadeClassifier to detect faces in a live video feed from the webcam.
The detectMultiScale function is utilized to identify faces in the gray-scale version of the video frame.
Image Overlay:

The code reads an image (apple.png) that will be overlaid on the detected face.
The apple image is resized to one-third of the width and height of the detected face.
The overlay is applied only to a small region of the frame where the face is located (1/3 of the detected face).
Modifying a Small Area:

The line frame[sy:sy + h//3, sx:sx + w//3] = k1m updates only a small region of the frame with the blended apple image (k1m).
This results in only a portion of the face being replaced, making the full face not fully visible in the output.
Blending Techniques:

To maintain visibility of the full face while applying the apple overlay, various blending techniques can be applied:
Weighted Blending: Using cv2.addWeighted() to mix the original face with the apple overlay.
Alpha Blending: Leveraging the alpha channel of the apple image to blend it transparently with the face region.
Full Face Overlay: Resizing the apple image to match the entire face dimensions to cover the full face.
Final Output Options:

Using blending allows the apple overlay to be applied while keeping the face visible.
Depending on the chosen blending technique, the output can show:
The face with an apple image blended into it (partial visibility).
A transparent overlay where the apple image is superimposed on the face (partial visibility).
An apple image covering the entire face if the overlay is resized to the full dimensions of the face.
